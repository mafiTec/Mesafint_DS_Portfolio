# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contanct me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](https://github.com/mafiTec/Linear_Regression_Project-Seoul-Bike-dataset./blob/main/Seoul_Bike_dataset.ipynb)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

<b>Skills Used:</b> Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Linear Regression

<b>Project Objective:</b> By predicting the bike rental demand in advance from weather forcat, Bike rental company position the bike according to custmerrs demand resulting in increase in bike unitilization.

<b>Quantifiable Results:</b> We could predict the bike rentals Resulting in 95% accuracy and 135% increase in bike utilization

  - Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
  - The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
  - Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of mWe can Predict the Customer’s Response with 91.25% accuracy.
any string columns
  - Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Predicting customer subscription for term deposit](https://github.com/mafiTec/-A-Classification-Algos-Logistic_Regression_Project/blob/main/Logistic_Regression_Project.ipynb)

<img src="images/log.jpg?raw=true"/>

<b>Skills used:</b> Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SKlearn, Logistic Regression, SMOTE, RFE

<b>Project Objective:</b> Used logistic regression to predict customer subscriptions for there term deposit (Used real worked data from UCI, machine learning repository)

<b>Quantifiable Results:</b> Used Logistic regression classifier got 91.03 % of model accuracy which helps the bank to estimate their depositors in advance

  - Used logistic regression to explore and make note of attributes information
  - Use data cleaning principles to get rid of the unwanted data
  - Explore data with groupby function and analyzing it
  - Used Logistic regression classifier to improve on the data to make better prediction on whether the client will subcribe or not
  - Explored a machine learning approach to predict by using Sklearn numeric

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](https://github.com/mafiTec/Classification-Algos-Knn_Nb_Project/blob/main/1_Knn_Nb_Project.ipynb)

<img src="images/orto.jpg?raw=true"/>

<b>Skills used:</b> Python,Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, K Nearest Neighbours

<b>Project objctive:</b> In this project the idea is to used logistic regression to predict if the client will subscrebed a term deposit or not by using data releted a marketing company(phones calls) of a portugues bank institution BPI from UCI.

<b>Quantifiable Result:</b> Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient’s condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters and got accuracy of 82.26 % for KNN and 82.26 % for NB

  - Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
  - Selected best model based on train and test performance
  - Tuned hyperparameter best score was 0.8586
  - The accuracy of the KNN with K = 17 is 82.26%
  - The accuracy of the NB is 82.26%
